I've just found out that one of my current working projects, entitled "Bayesian estimation of a large-scale macroeconomic policy
agent-based model", has been accepted at the [ECONDAT 2025 spring meeting](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/events/2025/june/econdat-spring-2025-economics-with-nontraditional-data-and-analytical-tools), co-organised by King's College London and the Bank of England. This is brand-new work, so I don't yet have a working paper out, but this will available shortly.
