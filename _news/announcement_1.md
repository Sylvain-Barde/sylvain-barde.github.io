After several years of procrastination following the closure of my previous webpage, I have finally bitten the bullet and decided that a new webpage is needed.

I've spent two 'spare' days during some traveling to set up a github pages site with a the lovely [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) Jekyll template. Right now there isn't much beyond the basic functionality, but I'll be adding more content, including some more practical (useful?) material relating to the various code repos I've generated over the years.
