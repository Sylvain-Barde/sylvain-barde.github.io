After a longer-than-expected and very thorough replication check by the Data Editor of the [The Econometrics Journal](https://academic.oup.com/ectj), our "Moranâ€™s I Lasso for models with spatially correlated data" paper has been produced and is available, with a DOI of [10.1093/ectj/utaf008](https://academic.oup.com/ectj/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ectj/utaf008/8045592?utm_source=advanceaccess&utm_campaign=ectj&utm_medium=email).
