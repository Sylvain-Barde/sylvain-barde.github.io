For now, this page just lists my current teaching. My to-do list for the webpage includes converting this into a more detailed collection, much like the [projects](https://sylvain-barde.github.io/projects).

### Undergraduate teaching

- [ECON3050 - Mathematics for Economics (mode A)](https://www.kent.ac.uk/courses/modules/module/ECON3050). This is a first year module covering the basic algebra and calculus required for intermediate Economics, covering systems of equations, matrix algebra, univariate and multivariate differentiation and constrained optimisation. Teaching involves both the fundamental Mathematical concepts and application to Economic problems.
- [ECON3060 - Mathematics for Economics (mode B)](https://www.kent.ac.uk/courses/modules/module/ECON3060). This is the same module as ECON3050 above, but designed for students without a Mathematics school-leaving qualification. The content is the same, but the pedagogical delivery and support are adapted to allow for the ability level of the students.
- [ECON3090 - Statistics for Economics](https://www.kent.ac.uk/courses/modules/module/ECON3090). This is also a first year module, this time covering the basic statistical theory required for an introductory course in Econometrics. Topics covered include descriptive statistics, probability theory, discrete and continuous probability distributions (namely the Binomial and Gaussian), the central limit theorem, sampling distributions, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, and finally an introduction to correlation and linear regression.

### Postgraduate teaching

- [ECON8860 - Computational Methods with Matlab](https://www.kent.ac.uk/courses/modules/module/ECON8860). This module is part of our PhD training program and is designed to introduce first year PhD students to Computational Economics, numerical methods and basic programming. Matlab is used for the applied workshops, on the basis of its user-friendliness, good documentation, and the fact it forms the core of the [Dynare](https://www.dynare.org/) toolbox used in the corresponding [Advanced Macroeconomics](https://www.kent.ac.uk/courses/modules/module/ECON8810) PhD module.
