I am a Senior Lecturer in Economics at the University of Kent.

I have a wide range of interests and find it a bit tricky to categorise myself: i am part computational economist, part econometrician, with interests in spatial econometrics, regional science, agent based models and pretty much any economic problem that faces computational constraints.
