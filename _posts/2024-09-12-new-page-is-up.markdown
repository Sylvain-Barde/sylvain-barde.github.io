After several years of procrastinating, following the closure of my previous webpage, I have fin ally bitten the bullet. I've spent two 'spare' days during some traveling to set up a github pages site with a basic Jekyll template. Right now there isn't much beyond the basic functionality, but I'll be adding more content, including some more practical (useful?) material relating to the various code repos I've generated over the years.
